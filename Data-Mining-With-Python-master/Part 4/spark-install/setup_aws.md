## Setting Up Amazon Web Services (AWS)

To use Spark on data that is too big to fit on our personal computers, we can use Amazon Web Services (AWS).

**If you are setting up AWS for a Galvanize workshop:**
It is essential to set up your AWS account *before* the workshop begins. Amazon may take several hours (up to 24 hours in extreme cases) to approve your new AWS account, so you may not be able to participate fully if you wait until the day of the event.

## Part 1: Create an AWS account

Go to [http://aws.amazon.com/](http://aws.amazon.com/) and sign up: 

- You may sign in using your existing Amazon account or you can create a new account by selecting
  **Create a free account** using the button at the right, then selecting **I am a new user**.
  
- Enter your contact information and confirm your acceptance of the AWS Customer Agreement.

- Once you have created an Amazon Web Services Account, you may need to accept a telephone call to verify your identity. Some people have used Google Voice successfully if you don't have or don't want to give a mobile number.
  
- Once you have an account, go to [http://aws.amazon.com/](http://aws.amazon.com/) and sign in. You will work primarily from the Amazon Management Console.

## Part 2: Verify your AWS account

- Log into the [Amazon EC2 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) and click on the "Launch an Instance" button. If you are taken to **Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** then your account is verified and ready to go. If not, please follow any additional verification steps indicated.

## Part 3: Notify Instructors

- If you are setting up Spark to prepare for a Galvanize workshop, please notify your instructors in the workshop Slack channel (or by e-mail) when you have successfully created your AWS account. If you have any questions about completing the process, please reach out to us and we will help.
